    "q2e": "many other cells contribute to the type 2 \n cytokine profile, including ILC2 and Tfh cells.",
    "q3": "IL-4 has a crucial upstream role in type 2 \n inflammation by driving the differentiation of \n Th2 cells which contribute to the production \n of type 2 cytokines.",
    "q4": "One overlapping role of IL-4 and IL-13 in the \n process of type 2 inflammation is their implication \n in the class switching process of B cells \n to initiate IgE secretion.",
    "q5": "IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are involved in the maturation, \n activation and accumulation of eosinophils observed \n in type 2 inflammation.",
    "q6": "In the lungs, the roles of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 \n cytokines during type 2 inflammation are solely \n focused on immune cells.",
